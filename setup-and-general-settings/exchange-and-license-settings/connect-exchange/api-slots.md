# Swap exchanges

All Gunbot license types can use an API slot system, this allows you to switch between different supported exchange accounts at no extra costs.

## Swap exchanges

On the **Swap Exchanges** page you can see how many API slots your license has, and enter up to this number of API keys to be registered for use.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you regularly switch between exchange accounts, it's easiest to leave your exchange API details in the exchange section for every exchange you plan to use.  
  
Then when you want to switch, just copy the master key from there and enter it on the Swap Licensed exchanges page.
